# Exercise 4

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Replace the current header in Car Tool with the Tool Header component.

**Requirement 2.** Create a new component named Car Table in the `Components` project. Please setup the appropriate folder structure.

Hint: When the `ToolHeader` component was added to the `Components` project it was added to the `Shared` folder. For the Car Tool and Color Tool components they will be added to the `CarTool` and `ColorTool` folders, respectively.

Move the table from Car Tool into the new component. Call the Car Table component from Car Tool.

**Requirement 3.** The list of cars should continue to be managed within the Car Tool component.

**Requirement 4.** Following the same pattern as Car Tool and Car Table, move the unordered color list to its own component. Call the new component from the Color Tool component.

Ensure it works!
